# Chapter 5&6
### The three things we’ll write for each class:
* #### Prep code
  ###### A form of pseudo-code, to help you focus on the logic without stressing about syntax.
* #### Test code
  ###### A class or methods that will test the real code and validate that it’s doing the right thing
* #### Real code
  ###### The actual implementation of the class. This is where we write real Java code
   
___
 ### How can you develop you class?
 * ##### Figure out what the class is supposed to do.
 * ##### List the instance variables and methods
 * ##### Write prepcode for the methods.
 * ##### Write test code for the methods.
 * ##### Implement the class.
 * ##### Test the methods
 * ##### Debug and reimplement as needed

 ### What is the Difference between for and while ?
 ##### A while loop has only the boolean test; it does not have built-in initialization or iteration expression. A while loop is good when you don’t know how many times to loop and just want to keep going while some condition is true. But if you know how many times to loop , a for loop is cleaner

 ### ArrayList<>:
 ##### - ArrayList is a class in the Java API
 ##### - ArrayLists have no special syntax and can change its size, dynamically
 #####  - ArrayList is in the package called java.util
