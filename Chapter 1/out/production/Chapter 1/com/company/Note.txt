- How to compile Java code:
   First  --> When you Run your application, compiler take this source code and turn it into byte code (.class) .
             This byte code is an intermediate code between source code and machine code .
   Second --> JVM (an interpreter ) takes byte code and converts it into machine code .


- Code Structure in Java:
    Java file --> it's about a class that contains declared methods
    Any application contains at least 1 class and only one main method


- To convert from data-type to another data-type:
    --> String num="29";
    --> int num2 = Integer.parseInt(num);                 // num2=29;

    --> int age=20;
    --> String ageString = Integer.toString(age);        // ageString="20";



- Java is an object-oriented-programming so, everything in java have to be in  a class


- Be careful about the assignment operator (=) and equal operator (==)
    --> int var = 5;
    --> if(var==5);


- Phrase-O-Matic:
    First  --> create 3 string arrays with different values
    Second --> know the length of each array , Then multiply it *the random() and convert in into integer;
               rand1 = (int) (Math.random()*lengthOne);
               rand2 = (int) (Math.random()*lengthTwo);
               rand3 = (int) (Math.random()*lengthThree);
    Third -->  String phrase = wordListOne[rand1] + " " + wordListTwo[rand2] + " " + wordListThree[rand3];
