# Chapter 2 :- Classes and objects

* The difference between procedural programming and OO programming:
* When you create a class you must know (instance variables and method)
* Class: it's about something that told VM how to create an object from it
* To create object, I must have 2 classes:
    *  First--> (Class type) Class that I wanna take object from it
    *  Second--> (Tester class) Main Class: Try out the methods and variables of the new object

## #Running Application
##### - When you create an object, it's stored in a place in the  memory called (Garbage-Collectible-Heap) , But when and how do you retrieve this space ?
##### - When JVM see that I don't use this object anymore, it makes object(eligible for garbage collection).
