# Data-structures

### TreeSet
##### Keeps the elements sorted and prevents duplicates. 
### HashMap
##### Lets you store and access elements as name/value pairs.
### LinkedList
##### Makes it easy to create structures like stacks or queues.
### HashSet
##### Prevents duplicates in the collection, and given an element, can find that element in the collection quickly.
### LinkedHashMap
##### Like a regular HashMap, except it can remember the order in which elements (name/value pairs) were inserted, or it can be configured to remember the order in which elements were last accessed

### It’s slower to insert something in an ArrayList somewhere other than at the end.
###### So using the overloaded add(index, element) method doesn’t work as quickly as calling the add(element)—which puts the added element at the end.
