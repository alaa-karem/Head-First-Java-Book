### How can you name variables?
* ##### It must start with a letter, underscore (_), or dollar sign ($). You can’t start a name with a number.   
* ##### After the first character, you can use numbers as  well. Just don’t start it with a number. 
* ##### It can be anything you like, subject to those two rules, just so long as it isn’t one of Java’s reserved words.
